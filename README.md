# holiday
an ncurses holiday project from 2019

this one doesn't accept any arguments or do much of anything other than look nice

since it requires ncurses, it's easiest to run on linux or macos.  you might be able to get it working with cygwin.  i don't plan to update this to work better on windows but i might if you ask.
